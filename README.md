# Catalog of Agrogeophysical Studies (CAGS)
This repository contains the source for the catalog [website](https://agrogeophy.github.io/catalog/).

## How to use the meta-database

The database is stored as a single `db.csv` files you can find in root folder. Stable releases can be found in Zenodo.
`db.csv` contains one row per study and all collumns are metadata descriptors. Please, check the [metadata description](https://agrogeophy.github.io/catalog_doc/). 

The easiest way to visualise the meta-database is directly through the [website](https://agrogeophy.github.io/catalog/). 
You can visualise/filter contributions thanks to: 
- the georeferenced map üó∫Ô∏è
- a dynamic table 

You can export all/filtered contribution after filtering using the download button üì•

Each contribution can be opened individually to see more details (and contact the author if needed). 


## How to contibute to the meta-database

The easiest way to contribute is to fill out the [online form](https://agrogeophy.github.io/catalog/input_form.html).

Send the form via email (don't forget to attached additionnal files such as a cover picture, notebook file). Once received we will open a pull request and test if the metadata csv file meet the CAGS requirements - If the test passed your contribution will be automatically upload to the catalog website
